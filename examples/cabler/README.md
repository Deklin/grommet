# Grommet Example App: cabler

This app demonstrates a small-sized application using [Modular Grommet](http://grommet.io/docs/documentation/modular-grommet).
We demonstrate mobile-first UI interactions that work great on desktop as well. This an application created to demonstrate topology view of a server with their racks connections.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to run `npm install` at Grommet root folder.

To run this application, execute the following commands:

  1. Start development server
    ```
    $ gulp dev
    ```

**NOTE**: If you want to use this application outside the Grommet context, checkout [Exporting Example Apps Wiki](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet/wiki/Exporting-examples-from-Grommet).
